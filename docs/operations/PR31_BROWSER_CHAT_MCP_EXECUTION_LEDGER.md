# PR31 Browser Chat Workspace and MCP Execution Ledger

## Authority

- Goal: `VS-PR31-BROWSER-CHAT-WORKSPACE-MCP-20260810`
- Branch: `agent/pr30-fixes-and-updates`
- Starting HEAD: `9fb5323f910a451aba16527a436e9f83e510b8c7`
- Worktree:
  `C:\Users\viper\VibeSpace\.worktrees\pr30-fixes-updates-20260802`
- Controller: `VS-ROOT-20260811T023519Z-BROWSER-CHAT-MCP`

## Preserved concurrent work

The initial dirty tree contains unrelated News, Benchmarks, Recycle Bin,
Agent, Skill, temporary chat-art, and web-dashboard-plan work. None is owned,
staged, restored, reformatted, or committed by this task.

## Refreshed external constraints

- OpenAI currently documents full custom MCP write/modify actions for ChatGPT
  Business and Enterprise/Edu workspace flows. Pro custom MCP remains
  read/fetch-only in Developer mode.
- ChatGPT freezes an approved app's tool snapshot; new or changed actions
  require an owner/admin refresh before they become available.
- Tauri's current multi-WebView API supports adding a `Webview` to a parent
  `Window`, plus show/hide/focus/position/size lifecycle operations.

## Baseline findings

- Browser Chat session membership is inferred from a persisted Zustand
  `chatPreferences` object rather than a durable binding repository.
- No `BrowserChatBinding`, provider-project link, or provider export snapshot
  table exists in Dexie V9.
- The native Browser Chat surface still uses a separate borderless
  `WebviewWindow`; it is not yet a true child WebView.
- The app-lifetime relay host and heartbeat acknowledgement are committed.
- The production MCP catalog remains truthfully read-only pending a real
  approval-session protocol; mutation capabilities are not advertised as
  available.

## Milestone evidence

### M0 — baseline refresh

- Status: `VERIFIED`
- Local branch/HEAD verified.
- Dirty provenance inspected and excluded.
- Master goal, repository authority, Browser Chat docs, Worker docs, and
  current OpenAI/Tauri documentation read.

### M1 — durable data/session foundation

- Status: `VERIFIED`
- Owned paths are recorded in the repository lock.
- RED evidence: the migration suite failed on `DB_VERSION` 9 and absent
  `browser_chat_bindings` / `provider_project_links`; the repository suite
  then failed 8/8 against an explicit unimplemented boundary. Two later
  selector/unlink tests failed on their missing methods.
- GREEN evidence: 25/25 tests pass across the focused repository and additive
  migration suites. V9 rows survive the V10 upgrade byte-for-byte while the
  two new stores start empty.
- Behavior: durable bindings and provider-project links now enforce exact
  account/workspace scope, unique VibeSpace-chat mapping, unique provider
  conversation mapping per profile, HTTPS provider URL allowlists,
  pin/rename/project/open-state updates, scoped selectors, and scoped removal.
- TypeScript: `npm run typecheck` in `app` passed after the final GREEN run.
- Formatting and diff hygiene: exact owned paths pass Prettier and
  `git diff --check`.
- Commit: `1be90cbf`.

### M2a — provider top-level navigation adapters

- Status: `VERIFIED`
- RED evidence: the new adapter suite first failed to resolve the missing
  module, then failed 9 behavior cases against an explicit null/deny stub.
- GREEN evidence: 15/15 provider-navigation cases pass; the combined
  navigation, repository, and migration gate passes 40/40; app TypeScript
  passes.
- Behavior: adapters accept only exact provider HTTPS origins and supported
  home/conversation/project paths, strip query/fragment metadata, extract only
  opaque conversation/project keys, and reject spoofed origins, credentials,
  non-default ports, and unsupported paths.
- Repository integration: binding and provider-project URL validation now
  consumes the shared adapter instead of duplicating provider URL assumptions.
- Commit: pending exact-path commit.

## Completion labels

Only `VERIFIED`, `IMPLEMENTED — NATIVE VERIFICATION REQUIRED`,
`IMPLEMENTED — PROVIDER VERIFICATION REQUIRED`,
`BLOCKED — PROVIDER CAPABILITY`, `BLOCKED — OWNER ACTION REQUIRED`,
`BLOCKED — TECHNICAL`, and `NOT STARTED` are used.
